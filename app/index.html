                <p> As I enter my 25th year in the wine industry, it would be fair to say that during this time I have seen the industry expand, develop and evolve. When we started Connoisseur it was to offer a modern, professional and flexible alternative to those already on the market. As time has passed, the market has naturally changed. Connoisseur has continued to develop and expand its portfolio increasing the type and number of services it offers, whilst maintaining its commitment to offering a high quality professional and highly dedicated logistical solution.

                <p>Our service to the Caribbean, and the Islands is managed and handled by our close partner, E Couriers. In conjunction with our partner we offer door to door delivery services including local temperature controlled delivery, if required. Our services include free domicile, ship stores in transit, and supply chain solutions to the major hotels and resorts. In addition to these services, we are pleased to be part of the E Zone system. This is an innovative concept which allows people that reside in the Caribbean and outlying islands to purchase goods online in the UK and have those goods delivered by the retailer to our facility for consolidation and onward shipment to one of our gateways which includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Antigua</li>
                  <li>Barbados</li>

                  <li>St Lucia</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We operate weekly or by weekly direct British Airways services. This is a great concept as it gives overseas clients the opportunity to purchase a range of goods from high street stores and have them sent door to door fully trackable at a cost that suits their pocket. The E Zone product is soon to be launched in the UAE, with Nigeria and other African states to follow.</p><a class="bth btn-warning" href="http://www.getezone.com/about-us/">eZone</a>

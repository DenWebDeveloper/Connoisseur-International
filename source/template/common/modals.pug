											p Connoisseur is one of the largest consolidators for the movement of alcoholic beverages to Asia. The shipment of wines to mainland China, however, is something entirely different…? The UK is a secondary market for wine and although as a nation we have fantastic allocations of some of the world’s finest wines you simply cannot just collect and fly the goods. China has strict rules and regulations in place for the movement of alcoholic beverages in order to satisfy the criteria dictated by Chinese customs and CIQ, the buyer and seller must first have made the appropriate contract. The buyer must have the relevant license in place to import wines and the seller must be able to provide the correct documents in original format. Meeting the appropriate conditions as dictated by the buyer and in line with customs and CIQ rules and regulations, the submission of these documents must be approved in advance. If and when this criteria is met, the wines being imported all approved with Chinese back labels affixed a shipping date and method approved and prepared, shipment can proceed. The Chinese market is challenging to service but not impossible, however, it must be done correctly. The local agent’s knowledge and support is vital as China CIQ often select bottles for sampling, these can be removed for sampling and not returned. Connoisseur are happy to assist with your enquiries and provide help to ensure the correct conditions are met.

											p At Connoisseur we spend countless hours researching the viability of shipping alcoholic beverages to certain countries. India is a market that we all wish to serve. Duties and Taxes have always been an obstacle to trade although those figures have become somewhat more balanced they are still very high. As a rule of thought, shipment of Alcoholic Beverages to India currently can only be made to those with prior approval of the wines or spirits they wish to import, in the event that the enquiry is a licensed entity. Connoisseur can arrange shipment by both Air and FCL Ocean.

Restrictions with regard to the personal importation of wines and spirits and the legislation in place in the various countries that make up Southern & Central America can make the importation of beverages be perceived to be impossible.

We do offer a full door to arrival airport service for this continent and will research and advise our clients of the required mandatory documents and local legislation. Shipments of beverages to companies who hold licenses and permits are not a problem and we can prepare shipments either by Air or Refrigerated FCL container.
